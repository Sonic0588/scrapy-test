  ,Washington, DC,—Today, Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) introduced the American Energy Efficiency Act of 2019 with cosponsors Senator King (I-Maine) and Senator Merkley (D-Oregon). The bill sets a national energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), administered by the states, to lower utility bills for consumers and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. EERS programs work by setting energy consumption reduction targets for electricity and natural gas, with targets slowly ratcheting up over time. Utilities meet these targets by offering efficiency programs to help their customers save energy, reduce waste, and save money.,
,Steve Nadel,, Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE): ,
,“We ,commend, Senators Tina Smith, Angus King, and Jeff Merkley for introducing the American Energy Efficiency Act of 2019, which would save consumers and businesses $150 billion dollars over 25 years of programs while saving energy and reducing emissions. Energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest way to address climate change, as indicated by the broad coalition of support from stakeholders, unions, and industry. The bill creates an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard to be administered by the states with staggering impact: saving 128 quadrillion Btu of energy (quads) over more than 25 years (which is more energy than the US uses in a year), reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 6 billion metric tons (more than the total US emissions in a year), and eventually resulting in 400,000 added jobs.”,

  ,Scorecard of 75 large US cities reveals the top 10, including Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Washington, DC., ,
,Washington, DC, — US cities are ramping up their clean energy efforts, notably with stricter energy-saving rules for buildings, but only a few cities appear on track to meet their community-wide climate goals, according to the ,2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard,, released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. ,
,For the first time, the ACEEE Scorecard tracks policy efforts to advance renewable energy in addition to energy efficiency, because both are needed to build a clean energy future and address climate change. It is the most comprehensive national report that tracks city progress toward climate goals. ,
,The Scorecard shows that cities took more than 265 initiatives to advance efficiency and renewable energy between January 2017 and April 2019, ranging from modest but practical efforts such as Philadelphia’s teleworking for public employees to cutting-edge policies such as Washington, DC’s new high-performance standards for existing buildings.  ,
,
,
,Yet the Scorecard also reveals that most cities with climate goals are either not on track to achieve them or are not yet tracking progress. One-third (27) of the 75 cities surveyed have yet to even set greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Of the 48 with targets, 21 are not yet fully tracking their progress. The remaining 27 have data, and of those, 8 are not projected to be close to achieving their targets and 8 are projected to make substantial progress but still fall short. Only 11 are on track to meet their GHG reductions goals. ,
,Cities vary widely in their policies and performance. The scorecard, which ranks cities on more than 50 metrics, has these key findings: ,
,Boston, ,retains its ,first-place ranking,, earning 77.5 out of a possible 100 points. It’s followed by ,San Francisco,,, ,Seattle,,, ,Minneapolis,, ,Washington,,, DC,, ,New York City,, ,Los Angeles,, ,Denver,, ,Austin,, and ,Portland,. This year, Minneapolis adopted policies requiring homes and apartment buildings to disclose their energy use to buyers or renters. New York City recently established programs calling for large buildings that benchmark energy use to post their energy performance ratings. ,
, ​​,Cincinnati,,, Hartford,, and, Providence ,are ,C,ities to Watch,. They did not make the top 10 but stand out for adopting several major clean energy policies and programs since early 2017, improving their ranks since the last scorecard. Hartford created an energy improvement district, began converting its streetlights to LEDs, and has taken steps to improve location efficiency through improvements to the zoning code. ,
,
,Cities expand,ed efforts to save energy in ,new and existing ,buildings. ,Since 2017, nine cities—Las Vegas, Mesa, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Reno, San Antonio, St. Louis, and Tucson—adopted more-stringent building energy codes and five advocated for their states to do so. In addition, eight cities—Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis, New York, Reno, Salt Lake City, San José, and Washington, DC—adopted efficiency requirements for existing buildings. ,
,
,
,Cities increased their push to reduce GHGs from the transportation sector, but ,not as much as they ,did ,with ,buildings,. To slash emissions, they need to accelerate their action. Since 2017, nine cities developed targets to increase public transit, biking, and walking in lieu of driving. ,
,
,
,Some c,ities are ,engaging ,with ,and invest,ing, in, low-income communities, ,and communities of color,. Still, they have ,significant room ,for improvement. ,They can tap, ,planning models—like those used in Minneapolis, Providence, and Seattle—to jumpstart their activities. ,
,
,
,
,""Cities are making impressive clean energy gains—taking big steps to waste less energy and encourage more renewable power. But they have more to do,” said ACEEE senior research manager ,David Ribeiro,, the lead report author. “Cities must continue their push for innovative buildings policies, take greater steps to tackle transportation emissions, and better track progress to know which investments have the greatest impact. With their innovation, ingenuity, and resolve, they can build prosperous and equitable low-carbon communities.” ,
,Boston’s Mayor Marty Walsh ,said: “Nearly three quarters of Boston greenhouse gas emissions comes from our buildings. We’re working hard to improve the performance of those buildings and looking at how new ones can be built smarter. If we’re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we have to accelerate our actions and lead by example. That’s why we’ve already surpassed our municipal climate goals and reduced emissions by 37 percent. I’m proud of Boston for leading the rankings once again and am inspired by other cities for their bold action.”     ,
,Minneapolis’ Mayor Jacob Frey,: “In the absence of leadership from the federal government, local governments have had to step up and take the lead on climate policy. Climate action is intrinsically linked to housing and equity, and we will continue to lead on efforts to make Minneapolis the greenest city in America.” ,
,Denver’s, Mayor ,Michael Hancock,: “The effects of climate change are very real, and they are happening right now. This is a time to lead, and our response must rise to the occasion of this challenge. Progress is being made at the local level, and Denver will continue to step up our efforts to reduce energy waste and pollution, as well as strengthen our resiliency as a community and make bold decisions to transform to a clean energy economy.” ,
,The 2019 report, our fourth ranking of cities, scores 75 large US cities, 24 more than our previous edition in 2017. It includes all 25 cities participating in Bloomberg Philanthropies’ ,American Cities Climate Challenge,, eight of which land on ACEEE’s top 10 list. This expanded Scorecard adds city efforts to encourage renewable energy, the impact of their policies, and their investment in and engagement with low-income communities and communities of color. Because of these extensive changes, we caution against simple comparisons to past scores and ranks. ,
,The Scorecard, using information collected as of April 1, 2019, ranks cities in five policy areas: ,
, ,Local government operations,. Austin, Boston, and Orlando tie for first place in this area. They have policies to increase efficiency in city government, procurement, and asset management. ,
,
,
,Community-wide initiatives,. Washington, DC takes top honors, followed by Seattle. They have GHG reduction goals, strategies to mitigate urban heat islands, and policies or programs to plan for distributed energy systems such as on-site renewables. ,
,
,
,
,
,
,Buildings policie,s,. Boston ranks first, followed by New York, San José, Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. These cities have adopted or advocated for stringent building energy codes, devoted resources to building code compliance, and used incentives or requirements to address energy consumption in existing buildings.   ,
,
,
,Energy and water utilities,. San Diego stars in this category, followed by Los Angeles, Boston, Chula Vista, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Their energy utilities have efficiency programs delivering significant savings, and the cities and utilities are working together to increase their use of renewable energy.  ,
,
,
,Transportation policies,. San Francisco takes the top spot, followed by Washington, DC, Boston, Portland, and Seattle. These cities promote public transit, efficient vehicles and vehicle infrastructure, and freight system efficiency., , ,
,
,
,
,“Year after year it is tremendous to see cities from every corner of the country ramp up their efforts to reduce climate pollution and improve lives for urban communities,” said ,Antha, Williams,, Environment Programs Lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies,, ,a major funder, ,of the ACEEE report. “The Scorecard documents the incredible growth of the field and Bloomberg is proud to support these efforts through initiatives like the American Cities Climate Challenge.” ,
,Lois DeBacker,, managing director of The Kresge Foundation’s Environment Program, also a major Scorecard funder, said: ""It is vital that cities move quickly to reduce their carbon emissions and that they do so in ways that engage and benefit all residents, including low-income communities and communities of color. ACEEE's City Clean Energy Scorecard offers a clear guide for local leaders to learn from one another how to transition to clean energy in an equitable manner."",

"
  ,Next Thursday, ACEEE will release the 2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard, our most robust report ever to track city progress toward climate goals. While this is our fourth city scorecard, it is the first to assess cities’ efforts to advance renewable energy in addition to energy efficiency. It also scores more cities — 75 this year, compared to 51 in our last report in 2017 — and it takes a closer look at equity and policy performance.,
,The results? You’ll find out next week when we dive into the details. We’ll reveal which cities did best, which advanced their clean energy agendas since 2017, and which are on track to meet their climate goals (if they have them). Before we wonk out though, we want to take a step back and share stories of people working to increase energy efficiency and spur renewable energy use in some of the cities we assess.,
,ATTEND THE WEBINAR,
,We reached out to several cities asking them to nominate individuals or organizations to spotlight for their work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We were overwhelmed with the response. Below we share stories from Denver, San Francisco, Hartford, and New York. They tell inspiring stories of organizations — and people — working every day to make their communities stronger, healthier, and more resilient.,
,
,
,Maceo May Veterans Apartments in San Francisco,
,
,This new construction project will provide 105 apartments to low-income and formerly homeless veterans and their families. ,Joanna Ladd, of the Chinatown Community Development Center in San Francisco says Maceo May is one of two new buildings that her organization and Swords to Plowshares are currently developing to house 30-50% of the city’s homeless veterans.,
, “We are always trying to push the envelope on energy efficiency in our buildings, because we own and operate them in perpetuity, and efficiency is our best insurance against rising utility rates,” says Ladd. “We are excited that the building will be receiving 100% renewable electricity from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and are taking full advantage by designing an all-electric building, supplemented with on-site photovoltaics, with no gas-powered building systems.”,
,Ladd adds, “With Maceo May, we also wanted to be sensitive about burdening our maintenance staff with overly complex building systems, since the maintenance of complex systems creates long-term costs as well. We settled on investing in a high-performance building envelope, with energy recovery ventilators providing tempered fresh air to each unit, to reduce the need for heating."",
,Hartford Area Habitat for Humanity,
,
,
,The Hartford Area Habitat for Humanity is doing its part to build more sustainable homes in Connecticut’s capital city. To better understand its work, we interviewed the group’s executive director, Karraine Moody. She explains: “Thanks to energy efficiency expertise, our volunteers, and other partners, we achieved our goal of creating a more affordable housing option for the Hartford community. We are the first Habitat organization in Connecticut to build a Zero Energy Ready Home.”,
,Moody says an affordable, efficient home is critical for homeowners. “In most cases, they are moving from apartments in need of much repair, saddled with a non-performing furnace along with appliances that lack ENERGY STARÒ rating. We have a workshop that focuses on…how to maintain their ENERGY STAR home. There is the a-ha moment in the workshop when they realize that the thermostat can be programmed to align with your daily routine and the gas bill should never reach $200 in any month.” ,
,The Habitat chapter will continue to build ENERGY STAR housing and plans to apply the lessons learned from its Zero Energy Ready Home to a development of six to eight homes.,
,Solar One in New York City,
,Cities are also working hard to spur renewable energy. To learn more about these efforts, we spoke to ,Noah Ginsburg,, co-program director of Solar One in New York City, which has worked with more than 200 affordable housing projects to install solar.,
,“What I love about my work at Solar One is that it really is about the mission: we want to make sure that our transition to clean energy benefits everyone, all New Yorkers, regardless of their income, building type, or neighborhood,” says Ginsburg. “We view this work as dual impact; we want to bring the benefits of clean energy and utility savings to these communities, but it’s also about affordable housing preservation. New York City has a housing crisis, and if we can reduce operating expenses, it can have a huge impact and help blunt some of the larger market forces that are driving displacement and gentrification.”,
,Ginsburg notes that the city and the state of New York are passing ambitious clean energy goals, legislation, and policies, and that’s critical. “We absolutely need that,” he adds. “We feel really grateful to have a city and state that are committed to that mission and to positioning us to have success with our goals.”,

,  ",,Coming soon: Largest US scorecard ever on  city clean energy efforts,," | July 18, 2019 - 11:38 am",
"
  ,As the United States swelters from yet another heat wave, much greater utility transformation — with energy efficiency at its core — will be needed to address the rise in extreme weather events and other factors linked to climate change. Yet state efforts to develop the utility of the future seem to be falling short.,
,Many US states and industry experts have been discussing and promoting the concept of the ‘utility of the future’—envisioned as a paradigm shift in the way electricity is produced and delivered. I recently ,presented research, on this topic at the European Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy Summer Study in early June. While some states are adopting ,bold new clean energy and climate policies,, the utility-of-the-future efforts have not generally been driven by climate objectives, and not at all by energy efficiency objectives.,
,An industry in flux,
,The electric utility industry in the United States is facing many challenges. These include: aging infrastructure needing major investment; economic pressure from slow demand growth; the need to integrate new technology; competitive pressures from alternative suppliers and customer-sited resources; and societal obligations from environmental, equity, and other policy objectives. As the industry faces major transformation, several leading states have begun to develop a utility of the future that addresses those challenges.  ,
,Overlaying this context is a growing awareness of the urgency of addressing climate change.  The recent United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ,report, tells us that we have barely a decade to make dramatic changes. This highlights the critical importance of what emerges from utility-of-the-future efforts in the United States. To achieve the necessary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, the United States needs the full-fledged participation, and indeed leadership, by our utility companies in promoting energy efficiency.,
,How much has climate policy driven power sector transformation?,
,To examine the intersection of these two pressing priorities (utility reform and the climate crisis), I reviewed regulatory orders, project reports, and other key documents for seven states that the trade press identified as leaders in examining the utility of the future. Those states include: Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Minnesota and Rhode Island. This review focused on two key areas: the extent to which their discussions were motivated by climate concerns; and the extent to which their efforts have emphasized energy efficiency. I also reviewed a dozen recent reports and articles on the subject of the utility of the future by key organizations and industry experts, to examine the prevailing thinking on this subject in the United States today.,
,To briefly summarize: states rarely mentioned concern about climate change as a major motivation for discussing the utility of the future. Rather, the motivating factors identified are much more traditional. By far the leading factors, mentioned prominently by all seven states, were: the aging infrastructure and the need for investment to maintain a reliable and affordable electricity grid; the need to integrate new technologies (e.g., advanced metering; smart communication technologies and distributed resources); and the drive to empower customers.,
,Many of the states and industry experts emphasize integrating renewable energy into the grid (although not necessarily with an explicit climate connection). Also, some states have other initiatives demonstrating their leadership on tackling climate change (our recent ,blog post, offers examples of states adopting aggressive clean energy policies). But with few exceptions, climate change has generally not been articulated as a driver for the utility-of-the-future discussions.,
,Energy efficiency, a clean energy workhorse, is too often missing from the conversation,
,Most disappointing was the fact that these discussions had almost no focus on the role of utilities in expanding energy efficiency. In several of the states there was a casual acknowledgement that utilities would continue to comply with other existing policy requirements for energy efficiency, (and on at least one occasion an ,effort to scale up efficiency,). Indeed, several of these states are leaders in our ,State Energy Efficiency Scorecard,. However, given the large opportunity and need to find a way to scale up efficiency investments in the utility sector, it was surprising and concerning that none of the states identified expanding energy efficiency as a driver for the discussion of the need for a utility of the future.,
,During the past century, the fundamental goal of the US electric system has been to bring “reliable, affordable electricity” to everyone. While those traditional factors are worthy objectives in discussing the utility of the future, they essentially ignore what arguably should be a—perhaps ‘the’—primary objective of energy utilities going forward: being leaders in the effort to mitigate climate change. We need our utilities to play a central role in reducing GHG emissions, and energy efficiency needs to be a major component of that effort.,
,Transatlantic learning on energy efficiency in the power sector,
,This highlights what is a striking difference between the European and the US approaches to utility sector energy efficiency. In Europe, climate-related objectives (reducing GHG emissions) are the driving motivation for energy efficiency policy, with almost no focus on the value of energy efficiency as a utility system resource. In the United States, the framing is exactly the opposite, with exhaustive focus on energy efficiency as a cost-effective utility system resource, and GHG reduction only occasionally mentioned, typically as an ancillary benefit. Each side could benefit from a better appreciation of the other’s perspective.,
,Greater transformation needed,
,Unfortunately, what one sees so far in US utility-of-the-future discussions is primarily the application of new 21st century tools (e.g., smart grid, integration of distributed energy resources, expansion of customer choice, etc.) to pursue the same old 20th century objectives (e.g., reliability, lower costs, shave peaks and achieve high system load factor, etc.). Given that greatly expanded energy efficiency must be an essential component of any feasible strategy to tackle climate change, its absence in these current discussions is a serious missed opportunity.  Reducing GHG emissions needs to be a defining mission for utilities in the 21st century, and much greater utility sector transformation is needed to adequately utilize energy efficiency to achieve that mission. ,

,Currently, Rick Perry is secretary of the US Department of Energy. Here are his predecessors,. Credit: ,US Department of Energy,. ,
,Of the 14 people who have led the US Department of Energy since its founding in 1977, only one is a woman: Hazel O’Leary, who served in the early 1990s. At the US Environmental Protection Agency, one-third of confirmed secretaries have been women.,
,These numbers are hardly surprising. The energy and environmental fields, especially the former, have traditionally been dominated by men. In fact, women account for only one-fourth of energy efficiency workers, according to the ,2019 U.S. Energy and Employment report,.,
,REGISTER FOR SSI,
,To explore the experiences of women in this field, ACEEE is hosting its first Women in Energy Efficiency event at our ,Summer Study Industry, next month in Portland, Oregon, with support from the Karen and Neal Elliott Fund. Two speakers will share their stories: ,Susan Stratton,, executive director of the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, and ,Christine Ervin,, former president/CEO of the U.S. Green Building Council and former US Assistant Secretary of Energy.,
,We asked three other women to tell their stories as well, including the leader of an environmental organization and two Summer Study panel co-chairs. They spoke candidly, sharing both their inspiration and advice.,
,When ,Kathleen Rogers, became president of the year-round Earth Day Network nearly two decades ago, she says the CEOs of all the major environmental groups were men. (Most of these groups are still led by men.) “It’s not as if they’re not awesome, committed men, it’s just that … sometimes, conversations [with them] can feel foreign,” she says. “Once you reorient them, I’ve found that they’re very responsive.”,
,“We just have to have the courage to speak up,” Rogers adds. “We do! Because I don’t find [men] resistant, I don’t find them rolling their eyes the way they used to—and trust me, they used to. But I think the barriers remain in the sense that you’ve got to be willing to stick your neck out even if you feel stupid—and I often do, because I’m bringing up a different way of looking at things. [Men and women] can go about things differently, so having that balance is really key.”,
,Kristin Bennett, and ,Emily Thorn Corthay,, who will co-host a Summer Study panel called “Inspirational Future,” also discussed their experiences. Bennett is the owner, president, and chief executive officer of KB Science, a research consulting firm based in Boston and Washington, DC. Corthay, president of Thorn Associates, is one of five certified energy manager (CEM) instructors in Canada.,
,Below are excerpts of our conversation.,
,What has been your experience as a woman in a male-dominated field?,
,Kristin: ,As mechanical engineer by first degree and geologist by PhD with a specialty in geophysics, crystallography, and texture analysis, I was often the only woman in the room, either in classes, meetings, or conferences. In 1988, as an undergraduate in engineering, I was the only woman with 85 men in my mechanical engineering classes at King's College. As an undergrad, I recall a male student saying to me that women’s brains worked differently than men’s, and women did not think like engineers. I got used to being different, underrepresented, and, well, lonely. ,
,Most in my direct community who know my work treat me with equity, for which I am grateful. On the other hand, others, who may not be clear on my experience and contributions, have judged, discriminated, and tested me twice or three times more than male colleagues.,
,I run my own company now, in our 11th year, as a woman-owned small business. I love what I do. I love our work. I care about the impact and our contribution to energy efficiency and helping to provide a better, cleaner, emissions-free world. I am proud to be a woman doing it.,
,Emily: ,I’ve found that we are sometimes held to a higher standard and have to prove ourselves more than men. Some of my obstacles have included having to choose how to confront (or ignore) sexually explicit material being posted publicly in university and in the workplace, learning after being hired that one of the decision makers said that “girls should not be working in laboratories but rather stay at home,” and being repeatedly mistaken for a waitress or administrative personnel at conferences when I was the instructor or leader. ,
,Opportunities, however, have also arisen—for example, with the increased emphasis on women in leadership roles. I was elected director of the board of the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, where I think that the membership understands the value of electing a diverse and gender-balanced board of directors.  ,
,What made you pursue a career in the energy field?,
,Emily: ,After reading a newspaper [article] on fuel cell technology, I immediately fell in love with the technology and spent the next five years in that industry. I then wanted to broaden my horizon to energy efficiency more generally and have grown to be very passionate about saving our planet (and my industrial clients’ money) through energy efficiency and carbon emissions reductions. ,
,Kristin,: I was attracted through crystallography to making or modeling new materials for energy-efficiency platforms. I also liked that working in the energy field, I had the opportunity to travel (e.g., New Zealand, Japan, Russia, India) to understand global energy efficiency concerns, tools, and solutions.,
,How have things changed—or not—since you began your career?,
,Emily,: Since I began my career over 15 years ago, there has been more emphasis on increasing women in engineering as well as women in leadership roles. In addition, a broader emphasis on equity, diversity, and inclusion is now the norm. ,
,Kristin,: After 30 years, the number of women in the mechanical engineering workforce remains about 7-9% ... As I have gotten older, I have become more accustomed to the lack of diversity in energy efficiency and feel more at ease in my career. I have found a few female mentors, though one turned out to be competitive instead of supportive. I have many examples still of being the only woman in the room. Today I chair the Strategic Advisory Committee, Energy & Environment S&T for Idaho National Lab, as the only woman on the committee. I have found certain management at the DOE labs less tolerant of sexual/gender harassment, which is promising.,
,What advice would you give a young woman interested in industrial energy efficiency?, ,
,Emily,: Industrial energy efficiency is a fast-growing field (in Canada, it’s growing at 8.3% per year, about triple the economy as a whole), so if you are a young woman, a career in this field will open up many exciting opportunities. I also think the process aspect of the industrial field—as opposed to commercial or residential—is complex and fascinating, so you will never be bored and can also improve your economic success as more complex custom industrial processes can command higher salaries/consulting rates. Most importantly, you are helping save humanity from the worst effects of climate change by reducing carbon emissions.,
,Kristin: ,Following my postdoc, I had a pivotal conversation with a woman leader and CEO for a successful biomedical research company. She gave me some enlightened advice: “Kristin, every woman in leadership feels lonely. You are not alone. If you want to make a difference in the world, and ‘make the world a better place,’ as you say, go back to what you know. Do what you love to do. Go back to the lab. There will you make a difference in the world, simply by being you. Make a difference by doing what you love.”,
,I would (and do) warn them, it is not easy in a male-dominated workplace, but it is worth it. Reach out to the Society of Women Engineers, ACEEE, C3E-like networks. Join as many women in science networks as you can. There are many. Document sexual harassment and do not be afraid to report it. Choose people to work with who respect your work, treat you equally, and celebrate your perspective. You will not be alone.,

  ,Florida cities and counties are going to bat for their residents and pushing for utilities to set stronger energy savings goals. Utility efficiency programs are a critical tool supporting local government efforts to improve sustainability, reduce emissions, and ,promote job growth,. But as cities and counties are working to ramp up energy savings, utilities are going backwards.,
,The Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (FEECA) ,directs the state’s Public Service Commission, (PSC) to adopt goals for utilities to increase energy efficiency and conservation efforts. In 2014, ,we reported, that energy savings goals for Florida utilities shrank significantly to about 10% of prior targets. The Commission revisits energy savings targets every five years, and this time around, it’s ,even worse than before,. In fact, four of the seven Florida utilities subject to FEECA have proposed goals of zero for the years 2020-2029.,
,Local governments are taking notice. In a series of resolutions and letters to the PSC, Florida cities and counties are calling for far more ambitious energy efficiency targets that align with local targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions. The City of Coral Gables ,passed a resolution, in early July that urges the Commission “to set meaningful, impactful, cost-effective, and conservation conscious goals.” Coral Gables noted that strong utility-run efficiency programs are an essential component of meeting the city’s 100% clean, renewable energy goal but that current savings from these programs fall well below the national average. ,Miami-Dade County, also linked utility energy savings goals to county-wide emission reduction efforts in a resolution adopted in May.,
,The city of ,Miami Beach, echoed calls for meaningful energy savings goals in their resolution, pushing for regulators to bring Florida’s energy savings in line with the national average. The city further urged regulators to fix the underlying practices that led utilities to propose such minimal goals – namely, the reliance on the Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM) test, which counts the revenues utilities could lose due to increased energy savings as a cost. Florida is the only state to rely primarily on RIM to assess its cost effectiveness programs. Other states have moved away from primary reliance on RIM, recognizing that it does not appropriately value energy efficiency as a resource.,
,These calls for improved regulatory frameworks and stronger savings goals were echoed by cities across the state. The cities of ,Dunedin,, ,Largo,, ,St. Petersburg,, and ,Sarasota, all submitted letters to the PSC asking regulators to use the FEECA process to set savings goals for utilities that would help, not hinder, local efforts to shift toward a cleaner and more resilient energy grid.,
,What’s next?,
,Next week, the Commission will convene stakeholders for hearings on utility energy savings goals. Already, FEECA dockets have been flooded with public comments (including ,comments from ACEEE,). At the hearings, the Commission will weigh the perspectives of various stakeholders, many of which will echo the points that cities have surfaced in their letters and resolutions. With cities and counties taking the lead in the shift toward clean and efficient energy in Florida, it remains an open question whether state regulators will give local governments and Floridians the support they need.,

  ,Statement of Steven Nadel, executive director,
,The Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), announced today by the US Environmental Protection Agency, misses a large opportunity to slash carbon emissions, reduce air pollution, and save money. The rule recognizes that energy efficiency measures at power plants can reduce both carbon emissions and consumer utility bills, but it will deliver relatively few savings.,
,The ,EPA estimates, it would reduce the power sector’s greenhouse gas emissions by 11 million short tons by 2030. While this may sound like a lot, it’s a small fraction of what could be saved. In fact, ACEEE ,analysis, shows that energy efficiency policies and programs for customers could reduce power sector greenhouse gas emissions by 600 million tons by 2030, increase GDP by $17 billion, create 611,000 new jobs, and lower the average American’s utility bills — saving them twice as much as it costs to install new energy-efficient technologies.  ,
,Utilities’ efficiency programs are cleaning the grid and saving money for families and businesses. They would have saved much more under the Obama’s administration Clean Power Plan (CPP), which the ACE will replace. Even without federal backing, states should still ensure their utilities and agencies are implementing all cost-effective energy efficiency to help their families, their economy, and their environment.,

  ,Joint statement by ACEEE’s Jennifer Amann, ASAP’s Andrew deLaski, and SWEEP’s Tom Polikilas,
,Washington, DC,—Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak signed ,AB54, into law this week, pushing back against the Trump administration’s efforts to ,roll back, energy-saving light bulb standards by adopting federal standards into state law. The measure will safeguard millions of dollars in consumer savings from the federal government’s misguided attack on efficient light bulbs.,
,Jennifer Amann,, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE)’s buildings program director: ,
,“Nevadans are helping to hold the line against the administration’s proposed rollback of light bulb standards. This bill will not only save Nevadans more than $85 million in electric bills, but it will also help reduce carbon equal to a year’s emissions from 60,000 cars from entering our atmosphere and destroying our climate.”,
,Andrew deLaski,, Appliance Standards Awareness Project’s (ASAP) executive director:,
,“Just when the Trump administration seems dead set on a senseless rollback of federal light bulb standards, Nevada is joining other states in stepping into the breach to ensure their residents will get the energy- and bill-saving benefits of these commonsense standards.”,
,Tom Polikalas,, Nevada Representative, Southwest Energy Efficiency Project’s (SWEEP) ,
, “AB 54 will ensure that Nevadans obtain and benefit from energy-efficient light bulbs, even if the Trump Administration proceeds with its proposed rollback of efficiency standards on reflector and other specialty lamps. SWEEP applauds the Nevada Governor’s energy office for proposing this bill, and the legislature for adopting it.”,
,Nevada will become the fourth state after Vermont (,H.411, from 2017), Washington (,HB1444, enacted this month) and California (existing regulations already apply 2020 federal standards to some bulbs sold in state) to put the federal light bulb standards into state law.,
,A bill with the same anti-rollback measure (,HB19-1231,) is sitting on Colorado Governor Jared Polis' desk, and he is expected to sign it Thursday, May 30th.,
,California has a ,regulatory proceeding underway, to expand the range of bulbs subject to their state standards to match the broader federal scope of coverage that the Trump DOE has proposed to eliminate.,
,Several other states are considering similar measures, at various stages of development.,
,According to ASAP, in 2025 alone, keeping the light bulb standards in place for Nevada will:,
,Save Nevadans more than $85 million in electricity bills,
,Save an average of $80 dollars per household,
,Reduce global warming CO,2, emissions by 280,000 metric tons, equal to a year’s emissions from 60,000 cars,

  ,As the market for indoor agriculture in North America surges, businesses, growers, and states are finding innovative ways to slash energy costs that demonstrate the potential for much greater savings.,
,Indoor agriculture — primarily flowers, herbs, lettuces, tomatoes, berries, and cannabis in greenhouses and other buildings — is a rapidly expanding and evolving industry across North America. Known as controlled environment agriculture (CEA), this energy-intensive industry was valued at roughly $47 billion in 2017. While its compound annual growth rate is projected at 3.4% for 2018-2023, some markets anticipate even faster growth, such as cannabis, with a projected 14.4% annual increase through 2025. As the industry expands, so does its energy use.,
,The ,latest issue brief, in our ,Emerging Opportunities in Buildings, series provides a snapshot of energy consumption in CEA facilities and the significant efficiency opportunities available. Reducing energy costs is vital to the industry’s success, because they account for as much as 25% of operating costs.,
,Efficiency investments can provide an important boost to the bottom line. While the food and flower crops grown in CEA facilities are typically higher in value than commodity crops, margins for growers are still relatively low. And in the cannabis sector, experience has shown that the high prices common when a state first legalizes adult use tend to collapse after a few years as the market becomes saturated and stabilizes.,
,Working closely with growers, equipment manufacturers have developed efficient LED lighting systems for different facility types including greenhouses, single-tier container farms, and multi-layer stacked vertical farms. HVAC manufacturers are producing specialized equipment to provide the precise climate, humidity, and airflow required for plant health, pest control, and mold prevention. These technologies allow growers to produce multiple crops over the course of the year and, in some cases, to produce significantly more product per acre of land and gallon of water than traditional agriculture.,
,These technical developments can reduce energy use by 30-50% or more, but substantial barriers have limited their broad adoption. Like many new industries, CEA faces a lack of access to capital as businesses work to demonstrate profitability to lenders and investors. Capital constraints are even more pronounced for cannabis growers, given federal limitations on banking for the cannabis industry. Limited data on energy use make it harder for growers to weigh the potential benefits of energy efficiency investments against perceived risks associated with adopting new technologies and practices or dealing with the disruptions of a retrofit project.,
,Fortunately, new programs and initiatives are emerging to address these barriers and support energy efficiency in CEA. Efficiency programs across the United States and Canada are offering technical assistance to growers along with incentives to offset the cost of efficiency investments and address capital constraints. The US Environmental Protection Agency recognizes indoor agriculture facilities that reduce their energy intensity through the ,ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry,. Additional resources and recognition for these facilities are under consideration.,
,The ,DesignLights Consortium, has added a specification to its portfolio that helps growers, contractors, programs, and policymakers to identify high-quality, efficient lighting for CEA facilities. Similar specifications could do the same for HVAC and dehumidification equipment used in indoor agriculture.,
,In the cannabis industry, the ,Resource Innovation Institute, offers educational programming on sustainable cannabis production and a benchmarking tool for growers seeking to gauge their energy performance relative to others. It is also developing best practice guides for lighting and HVAC design and operation.,
,To date, some degree of separation exists among programs, policies, and other initiatives for energy efficiency and sustainability in cannabis facilities and those in food and flower production. While different crops have different requirements, there are opportunities for collaboration and greater information-sharing across the CEA industry.,
,Policy can also play a role in reducing the energy impacts of the industry as it continues to grow and mature. State and municipal policymakers are beginning to establish energy use disclosure and other energy efficiency requirements on cannabis facilities. Similar policies for all CEA facilities, offered in conjunction with technical assistance and incentive programs, could help growers improve their viability while reducing their energy and environmental impact.  ,
,Today we are also releasing an ,issue brief, on residential dual-fuel program opportunities. While most energy efficiency programs target only one fuel, typically electricity or natural gas, dual-fuel programs have shown that broadening offerings to target multiple fuels can save more energy, reduce program costs, and improve customer satisfaction. This brief highlights best practices for dual-fuel programs, as well as innovative program approaches and technologies that can unlock deeper savings across multiple fuels. ,

  ,Major energy efficiency policies slashed US energy use by about 20% in 2017, saving a whopping 25 quads of energy —the amount used in California, Texas, and Florida combined.,
,Two US policies now at risk accounted for the majority of these savings. Vehicle fuel economy standards and appliance efficiency standards saved 14.3 quadrillion Btus, about 60% of the total savings and about 14% of all US energy use. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is proposing to roll them back (see ,here, and ,here,).,
,Savings from six key efficiency policies increased more than 15% since 2014, when we ,last compiled, our estimates. Savings in 2017 (listed in the table below) give a sense of the scale of efficiency’s impacts. Note that the estimate for each policy uses a different methodology, so the savings may not be fully comparable.,
,The figures total 26 quads, but I round down to 25 quads to allow for some overlap in savings estimates. These estimates, though, do not include savings from many other, mostly smaller, energy efficiency policies.,
,Here are six major policies that have dramatically reduced US energy use and the accompanying carbon dioxide emissions:,
,
,
,Vehicle standards,
,Fuel economy standards for cars, minivans, and SUVs, which first took effect in 1978 under legislation passed by President Gerald Ford, generated the largest energy savings in 2017. They saved an estimated 9.0 quads, according to ,figures, by the US Department of Transportation. We add savings of 0.3 quads (ACEEE calculations) from heavy-duty vehicle standards that were enacted under President George W. Bush in 2005. New savings from vehicle standards are expected to grow substantially through 2020 as a result of revisions established by the Obama administration. Further progress on passenger vehicles will depend on whether the Trump administration follows through on a ,proposal, to freeze standards at 2020 levels, and if it does, whether the courts sustain such a freeze.,
,Appliance and equipment standards,
,The second-largest savings, 6.0 quads, come from minimum efficiency standards on appliances and other types of energy-using equipment. These estimates come from a 2017 ,report, with updates by the ,Appliance Standards Awareness Project,, which is based at ACEEE. Congress has enacted standards on more than 50 products, beginning with legislation signed by President Ronald Reagan. The US Department of Energy (DOE) periodically revises these standards. Unfortunately progress has stalled the past few years as rulemakings have slowed to a crawl and, in the case of light bulb standards, the Trump administration has ,proposed, a rollback.,
,ENERGY STAR,®,
,Third on the list is the ENERGY STAR program, including ENERGY STAR homes, buildings, and equipment. ENERGY STAR has operated for more than 20 years, steadily expanding its market reach and participation levels. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ,estimates, that this program saved about 370 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity in 2017, which is equivalent to 3.7 quads. EPA estimates an additional 0.5 quads of savings in direct fossil fuel use in homes, buildings, and industry, for a total of 4.2 quads of savings.,
,Utility sector energy efficiency programs,
,Fourth is energy efficiency programs funded by utility customers and operated by either the utilities themselves or other entities designated by states and utilities. These programs help utility customers save energy and reduce their bills. They also help the utility and all ratepayers, because saving a kWh is ,generally less expensive, than generating a kWh. These programs, begun in the late 1970s in a few states, have expanded over the years and are now offered by utilities in most states. In 2017, these programs saved about 242 billion kWh and 400 trillion Btus of natural gas for a total of 2.7 quads. The electricity data come from ACEEE’s ,State Energy Efficiency Scorecard,. The gas data come from our 2017 ,report, on natural gas efficiency and also include more recent data from our State Scorecard.,
,Federal RD&D,
,Federal government energy efficiency research, development, and deployment (RD&D) appears to produce a similar level of savings as utility programs, but this estimate is very uncertain. Our figure is based on 2017 estimated savings from a ,2001study,, which in turn is based on work by the National Academy of Sciences and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. DOE has a substantial energy efficiency RD&D effort that has contributed to such energy-saving products as LED lighting, industrial process innovation, heavy-duty vehicle fuel economy improvements, electronic ballasts for fluorescent lamps, windows with special heat-reflective coatings, and advanced building analytic software. DOE has conducted ,more recent evaluations, on specific RD&D projects but has not estimated the overall savings and other benefits from its RD&D program.,
,Building codes,
,Building energy codes are next on the list, saving an estimated 1.5 quads in 2017. The first energy codes were developed in the 1970s, and code stringency has steadily increased since then, driven by new technologies and practices, as well consumer economics. Compared to 1980 codes, current national model building codes ,reduce, energy use by nearly 40% (residential) to 50% (commercial). Most states adopt one of these model codes as a statewide code, and some cities also adopt codes. Our energy savings estimate comes from our 2014 ,analysis,, with the addition of savings for 2015–2017 from the same sources. This estimate is highly approximate.,
,Caveats,
,These estimates, which are approximate, come from a variety of sources and employ different methodologies. Some, such as for RD&D and building codes, are highly approximate. Also, some savings estimates overlap, such as ENERGY STAR and utility sector programs. We crudely adjusted for this overlap by rounding down the total, but please note that this adjustment is inexact.,
