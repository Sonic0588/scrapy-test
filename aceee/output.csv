   Statement of Steven Nadel, executive director 
 The Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), announced today by the US Environmental Protection Agency, misses a large opportunity to slash carbon emissions, reduce air pollution, and save money. The rule recognizes that energy efficiency measures at power plants can reduce both carbon emissions and consumer utility bills, but it will deliver relatively few savings. 
 The  EPA estimates  it would reduce the power sector’s greenhouse gas emissions by 11 million short tons by 2030. While this may sound like a lot, it’s a small fraction of what could be saved. In fact, ACEEE  analysis  shows that energy efficiency policies and programs for customers could reduce power sector greenhouse gas emissions by 600 million tons by 2030, increase GDP by $17 billion, create 611,000 new jobs, and lower the average American’s utility bills — saving them twice as much as it costs to install new energy-efficient technologies.   
 Utilities’ efficiency programs are cleaning the grid and saving money for families and businesses. They would have saved much more under the Obama’s administration Clean Power Plan (CPP), which the ACE will replace. Even without federal backing, states should still ensure their utilities and agencies are implementing all cost-effective energy efficiency to help their families, their economy, and their environment.

"
   Washington, DC —Today, the Department of Energy (DOE) reversed course and sided with the gas industry, at the expense of consumers, by indicating it plans to ignore energy-efficient condensing technology when developing future efficiency standards for gas furnaces and water heaters. 
 This decision is the latest in a series of DOE actions that undermine US appliance standards which save huge amounts of energy, lower bills for consumers and businesses, and reduce harmful pollution. In addition to this rule, DOE is also  in the process of weakening  national dishwasher standards, rolling back the  light bulb standards , and providing a pathway for  manufacturers  to exempt themselves from product testing requirements. 
 Today’s ruling deals with efficient, condensing furnaces and water heaters that capture additional heat from the flue gases. A  report  from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) found that condensing technology has the potential to save consumers and businesses over $100 billion on their utility bills by 2050. 
 The gas industry has argued for years that these more efficient units should be a separate product class, so manufacturers can continue selling wasteful, outdated models. Although DOE has disagreed with the gas industry’s argument  as recently as 2016 , it is now reversing its decision to side with the gas industry. 
 Steven Nadel , Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE): 
 “Condensing technology can reduce the energy use of products such as gas furnaces and water heaters by about 10-20%. The gas industry has sought to eliminate DOE’s consideration of condensing technology since at least the early 2000s, but until now, DOE, under both Bush and Obama administrations, had repeatedly rejected the gas industry’s arguments.” 
 Gas Furnaces and Water Heaters 
 The first  proposed rule , published today, would benefit the gas industry at the expense of American consumers. This new rule, issued in response to a petition from the gas industry, would allow DOE to ignore condensing technology when developing future efficiency standards — creating a loophole for the industry to sell wasteful, outdated models. 
 Dishwasher Decision Pending 
 The second pending,  proposed rule  on dishwashers grants a petition from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a DC-based advocacy group. This plan is opposed by both manufacturers and energy efficiency advocates. The proposed rule would create a new product class for dishwashers with a cycle time of less than one hour. 
 CEI’s request is unwarranted because dishwashers that meet current standards and have the option of a short cycle are already widely available on the market. Dishwasher manufacturers today are providing consumers with wide-ranging choices of quiet, efficient machines that provide excellent washing performance while also providing the option of a short cycle. 
 It appears that the DOE will approve this new class of dishwashers in the coming weeks and assert that current standards on energy and water use will not apply to them. This move runs aground of the anti-backsliding law that prevents the weakening of appliance efficiency standards. If less-efficient dishwashers go to market, consumers will pay higher prices on their energy and water bills as a result.

   Scorecard of 75 large US cities reveals the top 10, including Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Washington, DC.   
 Washington, DC  — US cities are ramping up their clean energy efforts, notably with stricter energy-saving rules for buildings, but only a few cities appear on track to meet their community-wide climate goals, according to the  2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard , released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.  
 For the first time, the ACEEE Scorecard tracks policy efforts to advance renewable energy in addition to energy efficiency, because both are needed to build a clean energy future and address climate change. It is the most comprehensive national report that tracks city progress toward climate goals.  
 The Scorecard shows that cities took more than 265 initiatives to advance efficiency and renewable energy between January 2017 and April 2019, ranging from modest but practical efforts such as Philadelphia’s teleworking for public employees to cutting-edge policies such as Washington, DC’s new high-performance standards for existing buildings.   
 
 
 Yet the Scorecard also reveals that most cities with climate goals are either not on track to achieve them or are not yet tracking progress. One-third (27) of the 75 cities surveyed have yet to even set greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Of the 48 with targets, 21 are not yet fully tracking their progress. The remaining 27 have data, and of those, 8 are not projected to be close to achieving their targets and 8 are projected to make substantial progress but still fall short. Only 11 are on track to meet their GHG reductions goals.  
 Cities vary widely in their policies and performance. The scorecard, which ranks cities on more than 50 metrics, has these key findings:  
 Boston   retains its  first-place ranking , earning 77.5 out of a possible 100 points. It’s followed by  San Francisco ,   Seattle ,   Minneapolis ,  Washington ,  DC,   New York City ,  Los Angeles ,  Denver ,  Austin , and  Portland . This year, Minneapolis adopted policies requiring homes and apartment buildings to disclose their energy use to buyers or renters. New York City recently established programs calling for large buildings that benchmark energy use to post their energy performance ratings.  
  ​​ Cincinnati ,  Hartford , and  Providence  are  C ities to Watch . They did not make the top 10 but stand out for adopting several major clean energy policies and programs since early 2017, improving their ranks since the last scorecard. Hartford created an energy improvement district, began converting its streetlights to LEDs, and has taken steps to improve location efficiency through improvements to the zoning code.  
 
 Cities expand ed efforts to save energy in  new and existing  buildings.  Since 2017, nine cities—Las Vegas, Mesa, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Reno, San Antonio, St. Louis, and Tucson—adopted more-stringent building energy codes and five advocated for their states to do so. In addition, eight cities—Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis, New York, Reno, Salt Lake City, San José, and Washington, DC—adopted efficiency requirements for existing buildings.  
 
 
 Cities increased their push to reduce GHGs from the transportation sector  but  not as much as they  did  with  buildings . To slash emissions, they need to accelerate their action. Since 2017, nine cities developed targets to increase public transit, biking, and walking in lieu of driving.  
 
 
 Some c ities are  engaging  with  and invest ing  in  low-income communities   and communities of color . Still, they have  significant room  for improvement.  They can tap   planning models—like those used in Minneapolis, Providence, and Seattle—to jumpstart their activities.  
 
 
 
 ""Cities are making impressive clean energy gains—taking big steps to waste less energy and encourage more renewable power. But they have more to do,” said ACEEE senior research manager  David Ribeiro , the lead report author. “Cities must continue their push for innovative buildings policies, take greater steps to tackle transportation emissions, and better track progress to know which investments have the greatest impact. With their innovation, ingenuity, and resolve, they can build prosperous and equitable low-carbon communities.”  
 Boston’s Mayor Marty Walsh  said: “Nearly three quarters of Boston greenhouse gas emissions comes from our buildings. We’re working hard to improve the performance of those buildings and looking at how new ones can be built smarter. If we’re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we have to accelerate our actions and lead by example. That’s why we’ve already surpassed our municipal climate goals and reduced emissions by 37 percent. I’m proud of Boston for leading the rankings once again and am inspired by other cities for their bold action.”      
 Minneapolis’ Mayor Jacob Frey : “In the absence of leadership from the federal government, local governments have had to step up and take the lead on climate policy. Climate action is intrinsically linked to housing and equity, and we will continue to lead on efforts to make Minneapolis the greenest city in America.”  
 Denver’s  Mayor  Michael Hancock : “The effects of climate change are very real, and they are happening right now. This is a time to lead, and our response must rise to the occasion of this challenge. Progress is being made at the local level, and Denver will continue to step up our efforts to reduce energy waste and pollution, as well as strengthen our resiliency as a community and make bold decisions to transform to a clean energy economy.”  
 The 2019 report, our fourth ranking of cities, scores 75 large US cities, 24 more than our previous edition in 2017. It includes all 25 cities participating in Bloomberg Philanthropies’  American Cities Climate Challenge , eight of which land on ACEEE’s top 10 list. This expanded Scorecard adds city efforts to encourage renewable energy, the impact of their policies, and their investment in and engagement with low-income communities and communities of color. Because of these extensive changes, we caution against simple comparisons to past scores and ranks.  
 The Scorecard, using information collected as of April 1, 2019, ranks cities in five policy areas:  
   Local government operations . Austin, Boston, and Orlando tie for first place in this area. They have policies to increase efficiency in city government, procurement, and asset management.  
 
 
 Community-wide initiatives . Washington, DC takes top honors, followed by Seattle. They have GHG reduction goals, strategies to mitigate urban heat islands, and policies or programs to plan for distributed energy systems such as on-site renewables.  
 
 
 
 
 
 Buildings policie s . Boston ranks first, followed by New York, San José, Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. These cities have adopted or advocated for stringent building energy codes, devoted resources to building code compliance, and used incentives or requirements to address energy consumption in existing buildings.    
 
 
 Energy and water utilities . San Diego stars in this category, followed by Los Angeles, Boston, Chula Vista, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Their energy utilities have efficiency programs delivering significant savings, and the cities and utilities are working together to increase their use of renewable energy.   
 
 
 Transportation policies . San Francisco takes the top spot, followed by Washington, DC, Boston, Portland, and Seattle. These cities promote public transit, efficient vehicles and vehicle infrastructure, and freight system efficiency.     
 
 
 
 “Year after year it is tremendous to see cities from every corner of the country ramp up their efforts to reduce climate pollution and improve lives for urban communities,” said  Antha  Williams , Environment Programs Lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies,   a major funder   of the ACEEE report. “The Scorecard documents the incredible growth of the field and Bloomberg is proud to support these efforts through initiatives like the American Cities Climate Challenge.”  
 Lois DeBacker , managing director of The Kresge Foundation’s Environment Program, also a major Scorecard funder, said: ""It is vital that cities move quickly to reduce their carbon emissions and that they do so in ways that engage and benefit all residents, including low-income communities and communities of color. ACEEE's City Clean Energy Scorecard offers a clear guide for local leaders to learn from one another how to transition to clean energy in an equitable manner.""

   Florida cities and counties are going to bat for their residents and pushing for utilities to set stronger energy savings goals. Utility efficiency programs are a critical tool supporting local government efforts to improve sustainability, reduce emissions, and  promote job growth . But as cities and counties are working to ramp up energy savings, utilities are going backwards. 
 The Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (FEECA)  directs the state’s Public Service Commission  (PSC) to adopt goals for utilities to increase energy efficiency and conservation efforts. In 2014,  we reported  that energy savings goals for Florida utilities shrank significantly to about 10% of prior targets. The Commission revisits energy savings targets every five years, and this time around, it’s  even worse than before . In fact, four of the seven Florida utilities subject to FEECA have proposed goals of zero for the years 2020-2029. 
 Local governments are taking notice. In a series of resolutions and letters to the PSC, Florida cities and counties are calling for far more ambitious energy efficiency targets that align with local targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions. The City of Coral Gables  passed a resolution  in early July that urges the Commission “to set meaningful, impactful, cost-effective, and conservation conscious goals.” Coral Gables noted that strong utility-run efficiency programs are an essential component of meeting the city’s 100% clean, renewable energy goal but that current savings from these programs fall well below the national average.  Miami-Dade County  also linked utility energy savings goals to county-wide emission reduction efforts in a resolution adopted in May. 
 The city of  Miami Beach  echoed calls for meaningful energy savings goals in their resolution, pushing for regulators to bring Florida’s energy savings in line with the national average. The city further urged regulators to fix the underlying practices that led utilities to propose such minimal goals – namely, the reliance on the Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM) test, which counts the revenues utilities could lose due to increased energy savings as a cost. Florida is the only state to rely primarily on RIM to assess its cost effectiveness programs. Other states have moved away from primary reliance on RIM, recognizing that it does not appropriately value energy efficiency as a resource. 
 These calls for improved regulatory frameworks and stronger savings goals were echoed by cities across the state. The cities of  Dunedin ,  Largo ,  St. Petersburg , and  Sarasota  all submitted letters to the PSC asking regulators to use the FEECA process to set savings goals for utilities that would help, not hinder, local efforts to shift toward a cleaner and more resilient energy grid. 
 What’s next? 
 Next week, the Commission will convene stakeholders for hearings on utility energy savings goals. Already, FEECA dockets have been flooded with public comments (including  comments from ACEEE ). At the hearings, the Commission will weigh the perspectives of various stakeholders, many of which will echo the points that cities have surfaced in their letters and resolutions. With cities and counties taking the lead in the shift toward clean and efficient energy in Florida, it remains an open question whether state regulators will give local governments and Floridians the support they need.

   Washington, DC —Today, Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) introduced the American Energy Efficiency Act of 2019 with cosponsors Senator King (I-Maine) and Senator Merkley (D-Oregon). The bill sets a national energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), administered by the states, to lower utility bills for consumers and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. EERS programs work by setting energy consumption reduction targets for electricity and natural gas, with targets slowly ratcheting up over time. Utilities meet these targets by offering efficiency programs to help their customers save energy, reduce waste, and save money. 
 Steve Nadel , Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE):  
 “We  commend  Senators Tina Smith, Angus King, and Jeff Merkley for introducing the American Energy Efficiency Act of 2019, which would save consumers and businesses $150 billion dollars over 25 years of programs while saving energy and reducing emissions. Energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest way to address climate change, as indicated by the broad coalition of support from stakeholders, unions, and industry. The bill creates an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard to be administered by the states with staggering impact: saving 128 quadrillion Btu of energy (quads) over more than 25 years (which is more energy than the US uses in a year), reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 6 billion metric tons (more than the total US emissions in a year), and eventually resulting in 400,000 added jobs.”

   Washington, DC —Today, the Department of Energy (DOE) reversed course and sided with the gas industry, at the expense of consumers, by indicating it plans to ignore energy-efficient condensing technology when developing future efficiency standards for gas furnaces and water heaters. 
 This decision is the latest in a series of DOE actions that undermine US appliance standards which save huge amounts of energy, lower bills for consumers and businesses, and reduce harmful pollution. In addition to this rule, DOE is also  in the process of weakening  national dishwasher standards, rolling back the  light bulb standards , and providing a pathway for  manufacturers  to exempt themselves from product testing requirements. 
 Today’s ruling deals with efficient, condensing furnaces and water heaters that capture additional heat from the flue gases. A  report  from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) found that condensing technology has the potential to save consumers and businesses over $100 billion on their utility bills by 2050. 
 The gas industry has argued for years that these more efficient units should be a separate product class, so manufacturers can continue selling wasteful, outdated models. Although DOE has disagreed with the gas industry’s argument  as recently as 2016 , it is now reversing its decision to side with the gas industry. 
 Steven Nadel , Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE): 
 “Condensing technology can reduce the energy use of products such as gas furnaces and water heaters by about 10-20%. The gas industry has sought to eliminate DOE’s consideration of condensing technology since at least the early 2000s, but until now, DOE, under both Bush and Obama administrations, had repeatedly rejected the gas industry’s arguments.” 
 Gas Furnaces and Water Heaters 
 The first  proposed rule , published today, would benefit the gas industry at the expense of American consumers. This new rule, issued in response to a petition from the gas industry, would allow DOE to ignore condensing technology when developing future efficiency standards — creating a loophole for the industry to sell wasteful, outdated models. 
 Dishwasher Decision Pending 
 The second pending,  proposed rule  on dishwashers grants a petition from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a DC-based advocacy group. This plan is opposed by both manufacturers and energy efficiency advocates. The proposed rule would create a new product class for dishwashers with a cycle time of less than one hour. 
 CEI’s request is unwarranted because dishwashers that meet current standards and have the option of a short cycle are already widely available on the market. Dishwasher manufacturers today are providing consumers with wide-ranging choices of quiet, efficient machines that provide excellent washing performance while also providing the option of a short cycle. 
 It appears that the DOE will approve this new class of dishwashers in the coming weeks and assert that current standards on energy and water use will not apply to them. This move runs aground of the anti-backsliding law that prevents the weakening of appliance efficiency standards. If less-efficient dishwashers go to market, consumers will pay higher prices on their energy and water bills as a result.

   Washington, DC —Today, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) introduced the bipartisan  Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act . This legislation will improve building efficiency and reduce U.S. energy consumption and carbon emissions nationwide. 
 Steven Nadel , Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE): 
 “In the midst of scorched-earth partisan battles, we commend Senators Rob Portman and Jeanne Shaheen for introducing an energy efficiency bill that stands out as a commonsense, bipartisan solution. The Portman-Shaheen bill uses technology and best practices to save energy in homes, commercial buildings, and industry. The bill would result in better building energy codes, more aid to small manufacturing plants, and mortgage lending that recognizes the value of efficiency in homes. These are tangible energy efficiency solutions that transform waste into wealth by saving Americans money on their bills, all while improving the environment and the economy.”

   Florida cities and counties are going to bat for their residents and pushing for utilities to set stronger energy savings goals. Utility efficiency programs are a critical tool supporting local government efforts to improve sustainability, reduce emissions, and  promote job growth . But as cities and counties are working to ramp up energy savings, utilities are going backwards. 
 The Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (FEECA)  directs the state’s Public Service Commission  (PSC) to adopt goals for utilities to increase energy efficiency and conservation efforts. In 2014,  we reported  that energy savings goals for Florida utilities shrank significantly to about 10% of prior targets. The Commission revisits energy savings targets every five years, and this time around, it’s  even worse than before . In fact, four of the seven Florida utilities subject to FEECA have proposed goals of zero for the years 2020-2029. 
 Local governments are taking notice. In a series of resolutions and letters to the PSC, Florida cities and counties are calling for far more ambitious energy efficiency targets that align with local targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions. The City of Coral Gables  passed a resolution  in early July that urges the Commission “to set meaningful, impactful, cost-effective, and conservation conscious goals.” Coral Gables noted that strong utility-run efficiency programs are an essential component of meeting the city’s 100% clean, renewable energy goal but that current savings from these programs fall well below the national average.  Miami-Dade County  also linked utility energy savings goals to county-wide emission reduction efforts in a resolution adopted in May. 
 The city of  Miami Beach  echoed calls for meaningful energy savings goals in their resolution, pushing for regulators to bring Florida’s energy savings in line with the national average. The city further urged regulators to fix the underlying practices that led utilities to propose such minimal goals – namely, the reliance on the Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM) test, which counts the revenues utilities could lose due to increased energy savings as a cost. Florida is the only state to rely primarily on RIM to assess its cost effectiveness programs. Other states have moved away from primary reliance on RIM, recognizing that it does not appropriately value energy efficiency as a resource. 
 These calls for improved regulatory frameworks and stronger savings goals were echoed by cities across the state. The cities of  Dunedin ,  Largo ,  St. Petersburg , and  Sarasota  all submitted letters to the PSC asking regulators to use the FEECA process to set savings goals for utilities that would help, not hinder, local efforts to shift toward a cleaner and more resilient energy grid. 
 What’s next? 
 Next week, the Commission will convene stakeholders for hearings on utility energy savings goals. Already, FEECA dockets have been flooded with public comments (including  comments from ACEEE ). At the hearings, the Commission will weigh the perspectives of various stakeholders, many of which will echo the points that cities have surfaced in their letters and resolutions. With cities and counties taking the lead in the shift toward clean and efficient energy in Florida, it remains an open question whether state regulators will give local governments and Floridians the support they need.

 Currently, Rick Perry is secretary of the US Department of Energy. Here are his predecessors . Credit:  US Department of Energy .  
 Of the 14 people who have led the US Department of Energy since its founding in 1977, only one is a woman: Hazel O’Leary, who served in the early 1990s. At the US Environmental Protection Agency, one-third of confirmed secretaries have been women. 
 These numbers are hardly surprising. The energy and environmental fields, especially the former, have traditionally been dominated by men. In fact, women account for only one-fourth of energy efficiency workers, according to the  2019 U.S. Energy and Employment report . 
 REGISTER FOR SSI 
 To explore the experiences of women in this field, ACEEE is hosting its first Women in Energy Efficiency event at our  Summer Study Industry  next month in Portland, Oregon, with support from the Karen and Neal Elliott Fund. Two speakers will share their stories:  Susan Stratton , executive director of the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, and  Christine Ervin , former president/CEO of the U.S. Green Building Council and former US Assistant Secretary of Energy. 
 We asked three other women to tell their stories as well, including the leader of an environmental organization and two Summer Study panel co-chairs. They spoke candidly, sharing both their inspiration and advice. 
 When  Kathleen Rogers  became president of the year-round Earth Day Network nearly two decades ago, she says the CEOs of all the major environmental groups were men. (Most of these groups are still led by men.) “It’s not as if they’re not awesome, committed men, it’s just that … sometimes, conversations [with them] can feel foreign,” she says. “Once you reorient them, I’ve found that they’re very responsive.” 
 “We just have to have the courage to speak up,” Rogers adds. “We do! Because I don’t find [men] resistant, I don’t find them rolling their eyes the way they used to—and trust me, they used to. But I think the barriers remain in the sense that you’ve got to be willing to stick your neck out even if you feel stupid—and I often do, because I’m bringing up a different way of looking at things. [Men and women] can go about things differently, so having that balance is really key.” 
 Kristin Bennett  and  Emily Thorn Corthay , who will co-host a Summer Study panel called “Inspirational Future,” also discussed their experiences. Bennett is the owner, president, and chief executive officer of KB Science, a research consulting firm based in Boston and Washington, DC. Corthay, president of Thorn Associates, is one of five certified energy manager (CEM) instructors in Canada. 
 Below are excerpts of our conversation. 
 What has been your experience as a woman in a male-dominated field? 
 Kristin:  As mechanical engineer by first degree and geologist by PhD with a specialty in geophysics, crystallography, and texture analysis, I was often the only woman in the room, either in classes, meetings, or conferences. In 1988, as an undergraduate in engineering, I was the only woman with 85 men in my mechanical engineering classes at King's College. As an undergrad, I recall a male student saying to me that women’s brains worked differently than men’s, and women did not think like engineers. I got used to being different, underrepresented, and, well, lonely.  
 Most in my direct community who know my work treat me with equity, for which I am grateful. On the other hand, others, who may not be clear on my experience and contributions, have judged, discriminated, and tested me twice or three times more than male colleagues. 
 I run my own company now, in our 11th year, as a woman-owned small business. I love what I do. I love our work. I care about the impact and our contribution to energy efficiency and helping to provide a better, cleaner, emissions-free world. I am proud to be a woman doing it. 
 Emily:  I’ve found that we are sometimes held to a higher standard and have to prove ourselves more than men. Some of my obstacles have included having to choose how to confront (or ignore) sexually explicit material being posted publicly in university and in the workplace, learning after being hired that one of the decision makers said that “girls should not be working in laboratories but rather stay at home,” and being repeatedly mistaken for a waitress or administrative personnel at conferences when I was the instructor or leader.  
 Opportunities, however, have also arisen—for example, with the increased emphasis on women in leadership roles. I was elected director of the board of the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, where I think that the membership understands the value of electing a diverse and gender-balanced board of directors.   
 What made you pursue a career in the energy field? 
 Emily:  After reading a newspaper [article] on fuel cell technology, I immediately fell in love with the technology and spent the next five years in that industry. I then wanted to broaden my horizon to energy efficiency more generally and have grown to be very passionate about saving our planet (and my industrial clients’ money) through energy efficiency and carbon emissions reductions.  
 Kristin : I was attracted through crystallography to making or modeling new materials for energy-efficiency platforms. I also liked that working in the energy field, I had the opportunity to travel (e.g., New Zealand, Japan, Russia, India) to understand global energy efficiency concerns, tools, and solutions. 
 How have things changed—or not—since you began your career? 
 Emily : Since I began my career over 15 years ago, there has been more emphasis on increasing women in engineering as well as women in leadership roles. In addition, a broader emphasis on equity, diversity, and inclusion is now the norm.  
 Kristin : After 30 years, the number of women in the mechanical engineering workforce remains about 7-9% ... As I have gotten older, I have become more accustomed to the lack of diversity in energy efficiency and feel more at ease in my career. I have found a few female mentors, though one turned out to be competitive instead of supportive. I have many examples still of being the only woman in the room. Today I chair the Strategic Advisory Committee, Energy & Environment S&T for Idaho National Lab, as the only woman on the committee. I have found certain management at the DOE labs less tolerant of sexual/gender harassment, which is promising. 
 What advice would you give a young woman interested in industrial energy efficiency?   
 Emily : Industrial energy efficiency is a fast-growing field (in Canada, it’s growing at 8.3% per year, about triple the economy as a whole), so if you are a young woman, a career in this field will open up many exciting opportunities. I also think the process aspect of the industrial field—as opposed to commercial or residential—is complex and fascinating, so you will never be bored and can also improve your economic success as more complex custom industrial processes can command higher salaries/consulting rates. Most importantly, you are helping save humanity from the worst effects of climate change by reducing carbon emissions. 
 Kristin:  Following my postdoc, I had a pivotal conversation with a woman leader and CEO for a successful biomedical research company. She gave me some enlightened advice: “Kristin, every woman in leadership feels lonely. You are not alone. If you want to make a difference in the world, and ‘make the world a better place,’ as you say, go back to what you know. Do what you love to do. Go back to the lab. There will you make a difference in the world, simply by being you. Make a difference by doing what you love.” 
 I would (and do) warn them, it is not easy in a male-dominated workplace, but it is worth it. Reach out to the Society of Women Engineers, ACEEE, C3E-like networks. Join as many women in science networks as you can. There are many. Document sexual harassment and do not be afraid to report it. Choose people to work with who respect your work, treat you equally, and celebrate your perspective. You will not be alone.

   Washington, DC —Today, Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) introduced the American Energy Efficiency Act of 2019 with cosponsors Senator King (I-Maine) and Senator Merkley (D-Oregon). The bill sets a national energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), administered by the states, to lower utility bills for consumers and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. EERS programs work by setting energy consumption reduction targets for electricity and natural gas, with targets slowly ratcheting up over time. Utilities meet these targets by offering efficiency programs to help their customers save energy, reduce waste, and save money. 
 Steve Nadel , Executive Director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE):  
 “We  commend  Senators Tina Smith, Angus King, and Jeff Merkley for introducing the American Energy Efficiency Act of 2019, which would save consumers and businesses $150 billion dollars over 25 years of programs while saving energy and reducing emissions. Energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest way to address climate change, as indicated by the broad coalition of support from stakeholders, unions, and industry. The bill creates an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard to be administered by the states with staggering impact: saving 128 quadrillion Btu of energy (quads) over more than 25 years (which is more energy than the US uses in a year), reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 6 billion metric tons (more than the total US emissions in a year), and eventually resulting in 400,000 added jobs.”

 “Condensing technology can reduce the energy use of products such as gas furnaces and water heaters by about 10-20%. The gas industry has sought to eliminate DOE’s consideration of condensing technology since at least the early 2000s, but until now, DOE, under both Bush and Obama administrations, had repeatedly rejected the gas industry’s arguments.” 
 Gas Furnaces and Water Heaters 
 The first  proposed rule , published today, would benefit the gas industry at the expense of American consumers. This new rule, issued in response to a petition from the gas industry, would allow DOE to ignore condensing technology when developing future efficiency standards — creating a loophole for the industry to sell wasteful, outdated models. 
 Dishwasher Decision Pending 
 The second pending,  proposed rule  on dishwashers grants a petition from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a DC-based advocacy group. This plan is opposed by both manufacturers and energy efficiency advocates. The proposed rule would create a new product class for dishwashers with a cycle time of less than one hour. 
 CEI’s request is unwarranted because dishwashers that meet current standards and have the option of a short cycle are already widely available on the market. Dishwasher manufacturers today are providing consumers with wide-ranging choices of quiet, efficient machines that provide excellent washing performance while also providing the option of a short cycle. 
 It appears that the DOE will approve this new class of dishwashers in the coming weeks and assert that current standards on energy and water use will not apply to them. This move runs aground of the anti-backsliding law that prevents the weakening of appliance efficiency standards. If less-efficient dishwashers go to market, consumers will pay higher prices on their energy and water bills as a result.

   Statement of Steven Nadel, executive director 
 The Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), announced today by the US Environmental Protection Agency, misses a large opportunity to slash carbon emissions, reduce air pollution, and save money. The rule recognizes that energy efficiency measures at power plants can reduce both carbon emissions and consumer utility bills, but it will deliver relatively few savings. 
 The  EPA estimates  it would reduce the power sector’s greenhouse gas emissions by 11 million short tons by 2030. While this may sound like a lot, it’s a small fraction of what could be saved. In fact, ACEEE  analysis  shows that energy efficiency policies and programs for customers could reduce power sector greenhouse gas emissions by 600 million tons by 2030, increase GDP by $17 billion, create 611,000 new jobs, and lower the average American’s utility bills — saving them twice as much as it costs to install new energy-efficient technologies.   
 Utilities’ efficiency programs are cleaning the grid and saving money for families and businesses. They would have saved much more under the Obama’s administration Clean Power Plan (CPP), which the ACE will replace. Even without federal backing, states should still ensure their utilities and agencies are implementing all cost-effective energy efficiency to help their families, their economy, and their environment.

   Scorecard of 75 large US cities reveals the top 10, including Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Washington, DC.   
 Washington, DC  — US cities are ramping up their clean energy efforts, notably with stricter energy-saving rules for buildings, but only a few cities appear on track to meet their community-wide climate goals, according to the  2019 City Clean Energy Scorecard , released today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.  
 For the first time, the ACEEE Scorecard tracks policy efforts to advance renewable energy in addition to energy efficiency, because both are needed to build a clean energy future and address climate change. It is the most comprehensive national report that tracks city progress toward climate goals.  
 The Scorecard shows that cities took more than 265 initiatives to advance efficiency and renewable energy between January 2017 and April 2019, ranging from modest but practical efforts such as Philadelphia’s teleworking for public employees to cutting-edge policies such as Washington, DC’s new high-performance standards for existing buildings.   
 
 
 Yet the Scorecard also reveals that most cities with climate goals are either not on track to achieve them or are not yet tracking progress. One-third (27) of the 75 cities surveyed have yet to even set greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Of the 48 with targets, 21 are not yet fully tracking their progress. The remaining 27 have data, and of those, 8 are not projected to be close to achieving their targets and 8 are projected to make substantial progress but still fall short. Only 11 are on track to meet their GHG reductions goals.  
 Cities vary widely in their policies and performance. The scorecard, which ranks cities on more than 50 metrics, has these key findings:  
 Boston   retains its  first-place ranking , earning 77.5 out of a possible 100 points. It’s followed by  San Francisco ,   Seattle ,   Minneapolis ,  Washington ,  DC,   New York City ,  Los Angeles ,  Denver ,  Austin , and  Portland . This year, Minneapolis adopted policies requiring homes and apartment buildings to disclose their energy use to buyers or renters. New York City recently established programs calling for large buildings that benchmark energy use to post their energy performance ratings.  
  ​​ Cincinnati ,  Hartford , and  Providence  are  C ities to Watch . They did not make the top 10 but stand out for adopting several major clean energy policies and programs since early 2017, improving their ranks since the last scorecard. Hartford created an energy improvement district, began converting its streetlights to LEDs, and has taken steps to improve location efficiency through improvements to the zoning code.  
 
 Cities expand ed efforts to save energy in  new and existing  buildings.  Since 2017, nine cities—Las Vegas, Mesa, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Reno, San Antonio, St. Louis, and Tucson—adopted more-stringent building energy codes and five advocated for their states to do so. In addition, eight cities—Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis, New York, Reno, Salt Lake City, San José, and Washington, DC—adopted efficiency requirements for existing buildings.  
 
 
 Cities increased their push to reduce GHGs from the transportation sector  but  not as much as they  did  with  buildings . To slash emissions, they need to accelerate their action. Since 2017, nine cities developed targets to increase public transit, biking, and walking in lieu of driving.  
 
 
 Some c ities are  engaging  with  and invest ing  in  low-income communities   and communities of color . Still, they have  significant room  for improvement.  They can tap   planning models—like those used in Minneapolis, Providence, and Seattle—to jumpstart their activities.  
 
 
 
 ""Cities are making impressive clean energy gains—taking big steps to waste less energy and encourage more renewable power. But they have more to do,” said ACEEE senior research manager  David Ribeiro , the lead report author. “Cities must continue their push for innovative buildings policies, take greater steps to tackle transportation emissions, and better track progress to know which investments have the greatest impact. With their innovation, ingenuity, and resolve, they can build prosperous and equitable low-carbon communities.”  
 Boston’s Mayor Marty Walsh  said: “Nearly three quarters of Boston greenhouse gas emissions comes from our buildings. We’re working hard to improve the performance of those buildings and looking at how new ones can be built smarter. If we’re to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we have to accelerate our actions and lead by example. That’s why we’ve already surpassed our municipal climate goals and reduced emissions by 37 percent. I’m proud of Boston for leading the rankings once again and am inspired by other cities for their bold action.”      
 Minneapolis’ Mayor Jacob Frey : “In the absence of leadership from the federal government, local governments have had to step up and take the lead on climate policy. Climate action is intrinsically linked to housing and equity, and we will continue to lead on efforts to make Minneapolis the greenest city in America.”  
 Denver’s  Mayor  Michael Hancock : “The effects of climate change are very real, and they are happening right now. This is a time to lead, and our response must rise to the occasion of this challenge. Progress is being made at the local level, and Denver will continue to step up our efforts to reduce energy waste and pollution, as well as strengthen our resiliency as a community and make bold decisions to transform to a clean energy economy.”  
 The 2019 report, our fourth ranking of cities, scores 75 large US cities, 24 more than our previous edition in 2017. It includes all 25 cities participating in Bloomberg Philanthropies’  American Cities Climate Challenge , eight of which land on ACEEE’s top 10 list. This expanded Scorecard adds city efforts to encourage renewable energy, the impact of their policies, and their investment in and engagement with low-income communities and communities of color. Because of these extensive changes, we caution against simple comparisons to past scores and ranks.  
 The Scorecard, using information collected as of April 1, 2019, ranks cities in five policy areas:  
   Local government operations . Austin, Boston, and Orlando tie for first place in this area. They have policies to increase efficiency in city government, procurement, and asset management.  
 
 
 Community-wide initiatives . Washington, DC takes top honors, followed by Seattle. They have GHG reduction goals, strategies to mitigate urban heat islands, and policies or programs to plan for distributed energy systems such as on-site renewables.  
 
 
 
 
 
 Buildings policie s . Boston ranks first, followed by New York, San José, Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. These cities have adopted or advocated for stringent building energy codes, devoted resources to building code compliance, and used incentives or requirements to address energy consumption in existing buildings.    
 
 
 Energy and water utilities . San Diego stars in this category, followed by Los Angeles, Boston, Chula Vista, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Their energy utilities have efficiency programs delivering significant savings, and the cities and utilities are working together to increase their use of renewable energy.   
 
 
 Transportation policies . San Francisco takes the top spot, followed by Washington, DC, Boston, Portland, and Seattle. These cities promote public transit, efficient vehicles and vehicle infrastructure, and freight system efficiency.     
 
 
 
 “Year after year it is tremendous to see cities from every corner of the country ramp up their efforts to reduce climate pollution and improve lives for urban communities,” said  Antha  Williams , Environment Programs Lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies,   a major funder   of the ACEEE report. “The Scorecard documents the incredible growth of the field and Bloomberg is proud to support these efforts through initiatives like the American Cities Climate Challenge.”  
 Lois DeBacker , managing director of The Kresge Foundation’s Environment Program, also a major Scorecard funder, said: ""It is vital that cities move quickly to reduce their carbon emissions and that they do so in ways that engage and benefit all residents, including low-income communities and communities of color. ACEEE's City Clean Energy Scorecard offers a clear guide for local leaders to learn from one another how to transition to clean energy in an equitable manner.""

   Joint statement by ACEEE’s Jennifer Amann, ASAP’s Andrew deLaski, and SWEEP’s Tom Polikilas 
 Washington, DC —Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak signed  AB54  into law this week, pushing back against the Trump administration’s efforts to  roll back  energy-saving light bulb standards by adopting federal standards into state law. The measure will safeguard millions of dollars in consumer savings from the federal government’s misguided attack on efficient light bulbs. 
 Jennifer Amann , American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE)’s buildings program director:  
 “Nevadans are helping to hold the line against the administration’s proposed rollback of light bulb standards. This bill will not only save Nevadans more than $85 million in electric bills, but it will also help reduce carbon equal to a year’s emissions from 60,000 cars from entering our atmosphere and destroying our climate.” 
 Andrew deLaski , Appliance Standards Awareness Project’s (ASAP) executive director: 
 “Just when the Trump administration seems dead set on a senseless rollback of federal light bulb standards, Nevada is joining other states in stepping into the breach to ensure their residents will get the energy- and bill-saving benefits of these commonsense standards.” 
 Tom Polikalas , Nevada Representative, Southwest Energy Efficiency Project’s (SWEEP)  
  “AB 54 will ensure that Nevadans obtain and benefit from energy-efficient light bulbs, even if the Trump Administration proceeds with its proposed rollback of efficiency standards on reflector and other specialty lamps. SWEEP applauds the Nevada Governor’s energy office for proposing this bill, and the legislature for adopting it.” 
 Nevada will become the fourth state after Vermont ( H.411  from 2017), Washington ( HB1444  enacted this month) and California (existing regulations already apply 2020 federal standards to some bulbs sold in state) to put the federal light bulb standards into state law. 
 A bill with the same anti-rollback measure ( HB19-1231 ) is sitting on Colorado Governor Jared Polis' desk, and he is expected to sign it Thursday, May 30th. 
 California has a  regulatory proceeding underway  to expand the range of bulbs subject to their state standards to match the broader federal scope of coverage that the Trump DOE has proposed to eliminate. 
 Several other states are considering similar measures, at various stages of development. 
 According to ASAP, in 2025 alone, keeping the light bulb standards in place for Nevada will: 
 Save Nevadans more than $85 million in electricity bills 
 Save an average of $80 dollars per household 
 Reduce global warming CO 2  emissions by 280,000 metric tons, equal to a year’s emissions from 60,000 cars
